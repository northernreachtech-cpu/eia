## 🚀 How It Works

EIA Protocol enables seamless event management through blockchain-native features:

- **Organizers** create events with reputation tracking and performance metrics
- **Attendees** get ephemeral access passes and earn NFT proofs of attendance  
- **Sponsors** fund events with automated performance-based settlements
- **Communities** form around events with token-gated access
